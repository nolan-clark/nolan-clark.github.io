# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! 

This is a collection of projects I have completed throughout my academic journey, freelance work, or simply personal development in my free time. If you enjoyed exploring a specific project or know someone who would find it interesting, feel free to leave a ‚≠êÔ∏è or share it.

## About Me

üè° I am a Data Scientist out of Annapolis, MD, and I transform raw data into insightful visualizations. I believe all data has a story to tell and I enjoy translating that message for audiences to better understand. 


üéì My background in machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and dashboard development was developed while earning my M.S. in Data Science. My continued journey into data science is sparked by an interest in Large Language Models (LLM) and the possibilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. 


üß† Prior to my transition into data science, I held a career as a neurofeedback (NFB) clinician where I administered NFB therapy to alleviate symptoms of concussions, ADHD, anxiety, depression, and PTSD. This experience provided me a unique familiarity with both neural and muscular biometric data of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyography (EMG).

## Projects
<div id="badges">
  <h3>Automated Writing Evaluation System</h3>
  <a href="https://github.com/nolan-clark/Automated-Essay-Scoring-2.0"/>
    <img src="assets/AES.png"/>
 <p>Developed a deep learning solution for automatically grading essays by fine-tuning three pre-trained LLMs (Longformer, DeBERTa, and XLNet). Optimized performance through ensemble averaging, Optuna hyperparameter tuning, and GPU utilization. This project aims to streamline the grading process by providing consistent and accurate scores.</p>
    
   <h3>Capstone: LLM Text Detector</h3>
  <a href="https://github.com/nolan-clark/Capstone"/>
    <img src="assets/Capstone.png"/>
 <p>Built an end-to-end pipeline for textual feature extraction of transformer-based embeddings, TF-IDF, and LIWC-22 in python. Investigated predictive strength of text-based features for detecting LLM-generated text compared to embeddings. Applied SHAP explanations to examine feature importance of model authorship classifications. Produced highly accurate and interpretable classifier for distinguishing 6th-12th grade student-written essays from LLM-generated text.</p>
    
   <h3>Data Pipeline: Clash of Clans</h3>
  <a href="https://github.com/nolan-clark/Clash-of-Clans-CWL-ML"/>
    <img src="assets/clash.png"/>
  <p>Engineered a data pipeline from Supercell‚Äôs Clash of Clans NoSQL database using an API Key to generate 1 million rows of player clan performance data. The data was used to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) and develop machine learning models. Pipeline updates monthly to improve model accuracy and predictive strength.</p>
  
   <h3>Neurofeedback Study Analysis</h3>
  <a href="https://rpubs.com/Nolan_Clark/1037116"/>
    <img src="assets/NFB.png"/>
  <p>Provided descriptive and predictive analytics to be used for funding proposals. Solely handled the full data
process, from collection to report generation, to create a comprehensive report of previous Neurofeedback
therapy data.</p>
    
   <h3>Organ Donor Rates by Organ Donor Policy</h3>
  <a href="https://rpubs.com/Nolan_Clark/1005469"/>
    <img src="assets/DonorRates.png"/>
  <p>Modeled the organ donation rates of countries by organ donation policy and Legatum Prosperity Index measures
for predictive and prescriptive analysis. Modeling included stepwise linear regression and supervised machine
learning lasso regression.</p>
    
  <h3>USA Airport Multi-Dashboard</h3>
   <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nolan.clark/viz/Airports_Assignment/Dashboard1"/>
    <img src="assets/AirportDash.png"/>
     <p>Created three interactive dashboards of all United States airports to provide users with a tool for descriptive
analysis. The project can also be used as prescriptive analytic tool for choosing potential flight destinations.</p>

   <h3>Washington, D.C. Airbnb Interactive Report</h3>
  <a href="https://rpubs.com/Nolan_Clark/885963"/>
    <img src="assets/heatmap.png"/>
  <p>Conducted descriptive and prescriptive analysis on the Airbnb data of Washington, D.C. to determine best
listings, locations, and times to book with Airbnb in the area. The report includes 6 graphs, a choropleth map, and
a dot density map.</p>
    
   <h3>Seattle Police Department Call Analysis</h3>
   <a href="https://rpubs.com/Nolan_Clark/870953"/>
    <img src="assets/Police.png"/>
     <p>Conducted descriptive analysis on the Seattle Police Department Call Data (4.84 million rows) to assess the
historical efficiency at police call response.</p>
     
   <h3>Capital Bikeshare Dashboard</h3>
   <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nolan.clark/viz/BikeSharingVisualization_16407343099230/Dashboard1"/>
    <img src="assets/BikeDash.png"/>
     <p>Created dashboard of descriptive analytics for the activity of Capital Bikeshare users in Washington, D.C. from
